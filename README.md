# Python Sets

This project contains examples and explanations of Python sets and frozensets.

## Topics Covered
- Set creation
     Sets are written with curly brackets
     after creating a set, you cannot access its items using indexes since they are unordered
     1 and True are treated as same, also 0 and False
- add() method
    To add one item to a set use the add() method.
- Mutiple items use update() method

- Set operations
- frozenset
- add vs update
- disjoint sets

## Setup
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
