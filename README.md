# Python Sets

This project contains examples and explanations of Python sets and frozensets.

## Topics Covered
- Set creation
     Sets are written with curly brackets
     after creating a set, you cannot access its items using indexes since they are unordered
     1 and True are treated as same, also 0 and False
- add() method
    To add one item to a set use the add() method.
- Mutiple items use update() method
NB:The object in the update() method does not have to be a set, it can be any iterable object (tuples, lists, dictionaries etc.).

-  Use the pop() method to remove an item, but this method will remove a random item
-loop sets
-Join Loops using various methods
- Set operations
- frozenset
- add vs update
- disjoint sets

## Setup
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
